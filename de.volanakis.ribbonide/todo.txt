[DONE] * Ribbon buttons do not depress - added STYLE_PUSH
[DONE] * Bug: close shell, answer 'no' in dialog -> exception
[DONE] * Show window menu when ALT is pushed down
[DONE] * Quicktoolbar: no visual feedback on push - works in demo - need to check
[DONE] * Sync ribbon tab with active perspective -> perspective listener
[DONE] * Edit Tab: make 'open type' big and 'find' small

Committed:
* Finish 1st iteration of the tabs
* Hook buttons to the commands
* QuickAccessToolbar: need run, debug, step (?) icons
* QuickAccessToolbar: seperator element
* Extend RibbonToolTip to work as a regular tooltip too - don't always need the large tt

Bugs:
* QuickAccessToolbar: tooltips do not work
* QuickAccessToolbar: push mouse button down, move mouse -> will drag window
* BigButton stuck hover: click BB, click on view, hover still there, move cursor 
  to Ribbon, hover updated -> try a close listener on the BB-menu, reset/repaint hover on close 
* It seems that the image/text on large toolbar buttons is not always aligned -> check
* Arrow on large split buttons is not always centered: check 'Run' button

Ideas:
* About Ribbon: Help menu entry
* Update check
   - do not use p2/UM; just get a textfile from server
   - ask for permission, store preference, needs preference page
   - 1st iteration: dialog, 2nd: use notification area
* Feedback / Donation reminder
   - write timestamp to instance location
   - 1st iteration: dialog, 2nd: use notification area
* Custom Presentation: local toolbar hidden by default -> removes clutter, better vspace usage  
* Shell: cheese/flicker on resize - should use an SWT Tracker
* Replace gray menus with - nice looking menus for Big Button, Split Arrow Button - see Chrome 3.0 omnibar menu (slightly transparent)
* Do we need a 'catch all' tab for all other perspectives?
* 'Run tests' button on the ribbon, should show feedback (green / red)
* Ambient information (AI) + notifications (NF):
  - AI: could live on the ribbon: build status, recent commits, mylyn
  - AI: could use the big button; example for build status
  - maybe we just have one status area that shown different notifications / 'unread' messages indication
    - this could be extensible for build, mylyn, commits, etc.
  - most recent notification could be shown on
    - the RHS - at the height of the tabs +1
    - the status bar (mhh)
* Bugzilla element for Ribbon? (search # or text, create new bug) 
* Customization mechanism (ext. point and behavior)
  1. You should be able to define new tabs
  2. You should be able to define new groups
  3. You should be able to associate groups with tabs
     - have visible by default true/false flag 
  4. You should be able to associate perspectives with tabs
  5. You should be able to arrange groups by drag & drop
  5. Tab settings should persist
