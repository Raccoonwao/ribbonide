[DONE] * Ribbon buttons do not depress - added STYLE_PUSH
[DONE] * Bug: close shell, answer 'no' in dialog -> exception
[DONE] * Show window menu when ALT is pushed down
[DONE] * Quicktoolbar: no visual feedback on push - works in demo - need to check
[DONE] * Sync ribbon tab with active perspective -> perspective listener
[DONE] * Edit Tab: make 'open type' big and 'find' small

Committed:
* Finish 1st iteration of the tabs
* Hook buttons to the commands
* QuickAccessToolbar: need run, debug, step icons

Proposed:
* About Ribbon: Help menu entry
* Custom Presentation: local toolbar hidden by default -> removes clutter, better vspace usage  
* Extend RibbonToolTip to work as a regular tooltip too - don't always need the large tt
* QuickAccessToolbar: tooltips do not work
* QuickAccessToolbar: push mouse button down, move mouse -> will drag window
* Shell: cheese/flicker on resize - should use an SWT Tracker
* BigButton stuck hover: click BB, click on view, hover still there, move cursor 
  to Ribbon, hover updated -> try a close listener on the BB-menu, reset/repaint hover on close 
* It seems that the image/text on large tb buttons is not always aligned -> check
* Arrow on large split buttons is not always centered: check 'Run' button
* Replace gray menus with - nice looking menus for Big Button, Split Arrow Button - see Chrome 3.0 omnibar menu (slightly transparent)

Ideas:
* Do we need a 'catch all' tab for all other perspectives?
* 'Run tests' button on the ribbon, should show feedback (green / red)
* Ambient information on the ribbon: build status, recent commits, mylyn
* Bugzilla element for Ribbon? (search # or text, create new bug) 
* Mechanism for allowing contributions? (focus on java not xml)
